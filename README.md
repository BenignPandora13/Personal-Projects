# Personal-Projects

This is a repository for any non school and non proprietary software projectst that I write.
It isn't much now, but it'll probably grow as I write more software/do more with more languages. I should update this with code, but most of what I write is proprietary/school and so I cannot share it.

Languages I know or have some experience with/enjoy: C, C++, C#, Golang, Python, XAML, Matlab, OCaml, Prolog, x86 assembly, & VHDL.

Some cool stuff I've done:

C: Wrote proprietary I2C drivers to interface with ICs on custom hardware. Built cool data structures, system, and OS programs for school stuff - Not included in this repository

C++: Wrote a small linear algebra calculator to perform some linear algebra operations. Goal was to get familiar with C++ and its differences to C. 

C#: I've written proprietary automated hardware testing systems for aerospace applications. Additionally, I've written interpreters for RF telemetry streams to decode, error check/correct data, and displauy in real time

Golang: Simple HTTP server that I worked on for a few weeks in the summer in my free time while working. 

Python: School stuff for an undergraduate research thing

XAML: GUI interfacing for C# displays

Matlab: Some basic signal analysis and RF simulation

OCaml: Some introduction to OCaml for a class in school. OCaml is interesting - Might check that out more

Prolog: Same introduction stuff from the same class for school.

x86 assembly: Had to do some for a lab and part of a class - Interesting stuff, but I also like naming variables

VHDL: HDL's seem super interesting, and learning it in a class this semester
