# Personal-Projects

Last Updated: 7/24/24 

I don't have any large personal coding projects at the time of writing. Unfortunately, pretty much everything I have written is either for school or proprietary. I am starting with Verilog as a personal endevour, so I will try to put that on here.

I have thought about open sourcing my hardware work, but that's really not a high priority in my life right now. Everyone who needs access to my hardware source files right now has access to them.
