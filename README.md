# Personal-Projects

This is a repository for any non school and non proprietary software projectst that I write.
It isn't much now, but it'll probably grow as I write more software/do more with more languages


As of Spring 2023:

C:
C, if you don't count matlab, was the first programming language I ever learned, and in just a few short years I've become so much better at understanding not only how
to write C code, but what is really taking place underneath the hood when you compile a C program, and how things are structured. Probably won't have much C code on here
as nearly all of hte C code I've ever written has been for school, but maybe I will some day.

C#: 
C# was the first high level language I ever learned. I've built proprietary automated hardware testing systems, as well as data interpretors and GUI's for RF data 
streams. Building across multiple threads, updating GUI's with WPF and devexpress has made me a wizard with C# (if I may say so myself).

Python:
Most of my Python work is with CRE, but I want to do more with it, I'll get around to it. 

Golang:
I really like Golang, it has the quick fleible style of C, while providing a lot of the modern convienncies that can be baked into a language these days with minimal
effects on performance. I built a simple http server in my spare time, following a guide. It's not much, but again, school and C take up most of my time.


x86:
I really enjoyed my Assembly programming class in school. I felt that it gave me a great understanding of how a computer actually works, and I really loved working
with actual registers, which is pretty cool. I think I'm going to try to do a bit more with x86, I just haven't had a lot of the time with school and rocket.
